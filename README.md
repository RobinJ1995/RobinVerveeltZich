# "Robin Verveelt Zich" challenges

A set of "hacking" challenges I made for the members of the DigitalPlace.nl forum many years ago. Players need to extract a password from each of the challenges. Solutions go anywhere from highlighting a piece of transparent text, to extracting files that have been injected into the headers of other files.

Some resources that are required to solve these challenges may have been hosted on external websites that are no longer around.
